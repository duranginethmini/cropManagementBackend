# Crop Monitoring management system

## Introduction
This project is a crop monitoring system built using the **Spring Framework**. It is designed to manage the operations of a monitoring system, handling key functionalities like staff management, crop tracking, and vehicle and equipment management. The system is built on a layered architecture and uses logging for debugging and monitoring. With **JPA** and **Hibernate**, it ensures efficient database interactions and seamless **Object Relational Mapping** (ORM).

The system coheres to best practices, with clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data layers.

## Key Features
- **Vehicle Management**: CRUD operations to manage vehicle.
- **Monitoring log**: Functionality to create and manage monitoring logs.
- **staff Management**: Add and manage customer profiles.
- **Logging**: Integrated logging for event tracking and debugging.
- **Layered Architecture**: Separates presentation, business logic, and data layers.
- **REST API**: Provides API endpoints with JSON responses.
- **Exception Handling**: Custom exception handling and input validation using Spring Validator.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Spring Framework, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Communication**: AJAX
- **Logging**: Spring Loggers for application flow monitoring
- **ORM**: JPA with Hibernate for database interaction
- **Spring Data JPA**: For data repository layer
- **Lombok**: Reduces boilerplate code
- **JWT**: for security configurations

## System Architecture
The project is structured into the following layers:

- **Controller Layer**: Manages HTTP requests and responses.
- **Service Layer**: Contains the business logic and service implementations.
- **DAO Layer**: Handles data persistence and database interaction.
- **Entity Layer**: Maps to database tables via Hibernate.
- **DTO Layer**: Facilitates data transfer between layers.
- **Custom Exception Layer**: Handles specific exceptions and errors.
